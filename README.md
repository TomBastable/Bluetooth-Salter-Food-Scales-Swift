# Bluetooth Salter Food Scales Swift

Recently I've been challenging myself to connect to various pieces of bluetooth hardware and I have just finished working on connecting to Salters Bluetooth Food Scales. It was fairly straight forward apart from the Zero function. As Salter haven't issued any documentation for their scales, in terms of bluetooth usage for developers, this was slightly more challenging than it should have been. After 2-3 days of research and monitoring usage from the Android APK of the Salter Cook app, I managed to find the correct data that has to be written to the zero characteristic.
