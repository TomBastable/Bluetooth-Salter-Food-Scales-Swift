# Bluetooth Salter Food Scales Swift
## A case study into connecting to bluetooth peripherals that don't have documentation and deliberately don't conform to service specifications.

Recently I've been challenging myself to connect to various pieces of bluetooth hardware and I have just finished working on connecting to Salters Bluetooth Food Scales. It was fairly straight forward apart from the Zero function. As Salter haven't issued any documentation for their scales, in terms of bluetooth usage for developers, this was slightly more challenging than it should have been.
